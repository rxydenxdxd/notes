## What is NoSQL

- NoSQL Databases (AKA "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently then relational tables.

  > They are Document-based Model which is non-relational in nature.

- They are typically open source softwares. The software is free, and most of them are free to use in commercial products.
- In today's world, It is becoming easier to access and capture through third parties such as Facebook, Google, and others. SQL Databases were never designed to process data at scale. Therefore, NoSQL was introduced to handle the data of this magnitude.
- NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data, which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and does not fit the relational schemas of the RDBMS.
